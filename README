Automatically builds first table for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_percentage_of_population_living_in_poverty based on most up to date world bank data from their api.

get started/install

1. install python 3

2. install pip for python 3
sudo apt-get install python3-pip

3. install libs
sudo pip3 install -r requrirements.txt

4. run it
This program is designed to be run with python3
navigate to the directory of this readme in the console
Then run 
python3 create_table.py


Notes:

1. This program is not set up to auto post the table. It just ouputs the markup for a user
to manually add to this page. That funtionality may come later. For now though it should be manually checked. I will be doing this personally for now. My wiki user name is Lonjers. My email is utilitarianexe@gmail.com.

2. The program may take some time(5 min) to pull all the api data but it automatically caches so subsequent runs will be fast.

3. World Bank api is completely open at the moment don't do something stupid like delete the cache over and over and rerun this over and over. I don't want them to have to restrict their api.
